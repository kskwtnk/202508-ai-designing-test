## [2024-08-24] Header User Statistics Display

**Implementation Overview**: Added "Over 10 million users as of July 2025" statistics information to Neuroware Guide's Header.tsx

**Tech Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS

**Key Implementation**:

- Added text element to Header.tsx
- Responsive text size adjustment
- Enhanced visibility with accent color (fuchsia-600)

**Issues Encountered**:

1. Text placement issues on mobile display
2. Harmony with existing layout
3. Unifying appearance across different screen sizes

**Solutions**:

1. Utilized Tailwind responsive breakpoints (text-sm md:text-base)
2. Proper spacing with flexbox layout
3. Maintained consistency with design system colors

**Reusability**: Medium - Can be applied to other header statistics displays
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Tags**: [UI, Responsive, Header, Statistics]

## [2024-08-24] README.md Development Process Documentation

**Implementation Overview**: Created Mermaid flowchart for development process including visual-driven and specification-driven flows

**Tech Stack**: Markdown + Mermaid.js

**Key Implementation**:

- Visual representation of two development flows
- Process identification through color coding (blue, purple, green, orange, red)
- Clarification of common processes (PR, deploy, modification flow)

**Issues Encountered**:

1. Mermaid syntax errors (special characters, quotes)
2. Unnatural number jumps in flow (K3→K5)
3. Clear representation of complex flows

**Solutions**:

1. Replaced special characters with Japanese, removed quotes
2. Fixed numbers to natural consecutive order
3. Added gradual sectioning and comments

**Reusability**: High - Can be applied to process documentation in other projects
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Tags**: [Documentation, Mermaid, Process, Flow]

## [2025-08-25] Header User Statistics Enhancement (PR #9)

**Implementation Overview**: Enhanced header component with user statistics display, implementing Japanese typography optimization and performance-conscious font weight management

**Tech Stack**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Japanese typography optimization

**Key Implementation**:

- Added user statistics text to header with `justify-between` layout
- Implemented Japanese text line break control with `<wbr />` tags
- Applied `wrap-anywhere break-keep` for Japanese typography rules
- Optimized font weight usage (limited to 400/700 for performance)
- Added responsive text sizing and proper visual alignment

**Issues Encountered**:

1. **Japanese Text Line Breaks**: Default CSS behavior caused inappropriate line breaks in Japanese statistical text
2. **Font Weight Performance**: Used `font-medium` (500) when project limits weights to 400/700 for Japanese font optimization  
3. **Header Layout Balance**: Initial `justify-center` layout didn't accommodate both logo and statistics effectively
4. **Visual Spacing**: Need for consistent spacing between header elements while maintaining responsive behavior

**Solutions**:

1. **Japanese Typography Control**:
   - Strategic `<wbr />` placement at natural semantic breaks ("7月時点で<wbr />1,000万人")
   - Applied `wrap-anywhere break-keep` CSS classes for Japanese line break rules
   - Used `text-right` alignment for visual balance

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Changed `font-medium` to `font-bold` to align with project font restrictions
   - Verified font configuration in `layout.tsx` before implementation

3. **Layout Enhancement**:
   - Switched from `justify-center` to `justify-between` for proper space distribution
   - Added `gap-4` matching header padding for consistent spacing
   - Implemented responsive text sizing (`text-xs sm:text-sm`)

**Reusability**: High - Japanese typography patterns and header layout approaches applicable across Japanese web projects

**Difficulty**: Medium - Requires understanding of Japanese typography, performance optimization, and responsive design principles

**Tags**: [Japanese Typography, Performance Optimization, Header Layout, Responsive Design, Font Management]

### Key Learnings for Future Implementations

1. **Japanese Text Handling**:
   - Always consider Japanese-specific line breaking when implementing Japanese content
   - Use `<wbr />` tags at strategic points for natural line breaks
   - Apply `wrap-anywhere break-keep` for Japanese typography compliance

2. **Performance-Conscious Design**:
   - Check project font weight limitations before implementation
   - Japanese fonts benefit significantly from weight limitation (400/700 only)
   - Always verify font configuration in `layout.tsx`

3. **Layout Planning**:
   - Consider final content requirements when choosing layout approach
   - Use consistent spacing patterns (`gap` matching `padding` where appropriate)
   - Plan for visual balance when adding elements to existing components

4. **Responsive Implementation**:
   - Test Japanese text behavior across different screen sizes
   - Implement mobile-first responsive text sizing
   - Ensure readability on all devices for non-Latin text
