## Japanese Text Line Break Control (PR #9 - 2025-08-25)

**Occurrence Context**: Adding user statistics text to header component with Japanese content requiring proper line break handling

**Problem Details**: Japanese text "2025年7月時点で1,000万人以上のユーザー" was breaking inappropriately on different screen sizes, affecting readability and visual balance in the header layout

**Attempted Solutions**: 
- Initially used standard responsive classes without Japanese-specific line break control
- Tried manual spacing adjustments without considering Japanese typography rules

**Final Solution**: 
- Added `<wbr />` tag between "7月時点で" and "1,000万人" for strategic line break control
- Applied `wrap-anywhere break-keep` CSS classes to maintain Japanese line break rules
- Used `text-right` alignment for visual balance in header layout

**Root Cause**: Default CSS line-breaking behavior doesn't account for Japanese typography conventions and optimal reading patterns

**Prevention Method**: 
- Always consider Japanese text flow when implementing Japanese content
- Use `<wbr />` tags at natural semantic breaks in Japanese text
- Apply `wrap-anywhere break-keep` for Japanese content display
- Test responsive behavior specifically with Japanese text content

**References**: 
- Japanese typography guidelines
- CSS `word-break` and `line-break` properties documentation
- Project example at `src/app/page.tsx:L72-L79`

## Font Weight Management for Performance (PR #9 - 2025-08-25)

**Occurrence Context**: Using `font-medium` class in header statistics text while project font configuration limits weights to 400 and 700 only

**Problem Details**: Project restricts font weights to normal (400) and bold (700) for performance optimization, but `font-medium` (500) was being used, potentially causing font loading issues

**Attempted Solutions**: 
- Initially implemented with `font-medium` without checking project font configuration
- Assumed standard Tailwind font weights would be available

**Final Solution**: 
- Changed `font-medium` to `font-bold` to align with project font weight restrictions
- Verified font weight limitations in `src/app/layout.tsx:L9`

**Root Cause**: Lack of awareness about project-specific font weight limitations and performance optimization strategies for Japanese fonts

**Prevention Method**: 
- Always check `layout.tsx` font configuration before using font weight classes
- Understand that Japanese font files are larger and limiting weights improves performance
- Document font weight restrictions clearly in project guidelines
- Use only `font-normal` (400) and `font-bold` (700) in Japanese projects

**References**: 
- `src/app/layout.tsx` font configuration

## Header Layout Spacing Optimization (PR #9 - 2025-08-25)

**Occurrence Context**: Adding user statistics to existing header layout while maintaining visual balance and proper spacing

**Problem Details**: Initial implementation with `justify-center` didn't provide adequate space for both logo and statistics, requiring layout adjustment for proper visual hierarchy

**Attempted Solutions**: 
- Started with centered layout approach
- Manual margin/padding adjustments

**Final Solution**: 
- Changed from `justify-center` to `justify-between` for proper space distribution
- Added `gap-4` to match header padding (`px-4`) for consistent spacing
- Used `text-right` alignment for statistics text to balance against left-aligned logo

**Root Cause**: Initial layout approach didn't account for the need to display both branding and statistical information with equal visual weight

**Prevention Method**: 
- Consider content requirements before selecting layout approach (`justify-center` vs `justify-between`)
- Use consistent spacing values (match `gap` with `padding` where appropriate)
- Plan for visual balance when adding new elements to existing layouts

**References**: 
- Flexbox layout patterns
- Tailwind CSS spacing system
